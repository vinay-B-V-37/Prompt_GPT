# AI Chatbot Readme

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates how to use the OpenAI API to create an AI-powered chatbot. The script interacts with the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model to generate responses based on user prompts.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, you'll need to set up your environment:

1. Install the required Python packages using the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install openai python-dotenv
   ```

2. Obtain an API key from OpenAI by signing up on their platform.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the repository and add your OpenAI API key as follows:

   ```dotenv
   OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OWN_API_KEY
   ```

3. Run the script by executing the following command:

   ```bash
   python chatbot.py
   ```

## Usage

The `chatbot.py` script demonstrates how to use the OpenAI API to create a chatbot. It defines a function `get_completion(prompt, model)` that takes a prompt as input and returns a response generated by the GPT-3.5 Turbo model. The chatbot can be customized by providing specific instructions and structured data to the model.

Modify the `describe` variable to provide instructions and structured data to the model for better responses.

## Example

```python
describe = """
Instruct the model with specific instructions and structured data of your model (Supervised Learning)
"""

prompt = f"""
Summarize information about your desired output, and provide an idea of the required output.

describe: ```{describe}```
"""

response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

Feel free to experiment with different prompts and instructions to see how the chatbot generates responses.

## License
```

Just replace `YOUR_OWN_API_KEY` with your actual OpenAI API key in the `.env` file, and make sure to adjust the content as needed.
